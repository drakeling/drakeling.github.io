Its sleek, Java 8 design involves the most elegant and agile design practices, providing the end use with the best possible feeling. Joezer is not only a framework, its a way of life (See our Merc Tables and Web Portal!). </p> 
	     <p class="pagebody">Join the revolution today and enjoy the benefits of the ultimate de facto mapping software, providing the most pristine sensation of accomplishment with nearly no effort from the user base. Let all your worries melt away with the Joezer Framework, and let your mind imagine other concerns that will drive your software to new heights. In an interview with Joe, creator of Joezer, spoke on his inspiration on this nearly religious experience, stating "I wanted people to use DTOs"; that single statement is the spark, the seed of inspiration, the invigorating experience that birthed Joezer into existence. Invest in Joezer today. </p>
